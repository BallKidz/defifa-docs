# What is Defifa

Defifa is a dynamic arcade-like protocol that empowers individuals to unleash their creativity by creating a diverse range of 'money games'. These games can be anything from sports betting to prediction markets, and are self-refereed by the players themselves. Defifa is built atop the Juicebox protocol, and is governed by the $DEFIFA token.

## What are money games?

The concept of money games combines entertainment and the potential for financial gain or loss based on the outcome or performance within the game. Money games can include various forms of gambling, sports betting, online trading, predictions, and skill-based competitions. Importantly, they are self-refereed by the players themselves, meaning no external oracle validation is necessary to determine the outcome of a Defifa instance.

## Motivation

\*\*INSERT Origin story here\*\*

Defifa is a ‘money games’ arcade where anyone may spawn a group of playable positions and a collective objective in order to raise money and have fun.

For example, a game can be created for the NBA Playoff Finals where there are 8 mintable positions: Team 1 in 4 [5,6,7] games, and Team 2 in 4 [5,6,7] games, with the pot being used to back the value of the winning positions. Winners are determined by the players themselves, and the conditions for winning can be conveyed upfront before minting begins, for example 40% of the pot backs the players who chose the right team in the right number of games, 50% of the pot backs the players who chose the winning team in the wrong number of games, and 10% of the pot to those who chose the wrong team but the right number of games. The game can be set up such that X% of the initial pot is used to fundraise for Kraus House DAO, or whoever.

The winners never receive funds directly. Instead, the treasury is rearranged to back the value of the winning positions – at any time, players can burn their NFTs to reclaim their winnings.

Another example is a prediction market for a musician launching an album on Spotify. The game can be framed as “How many listens will this album have in 3 months time?”, with the pot being split between the closest guesses, and an initial subset being used to merch for a tour. Offering a captivating collection of games, from sporting competitions to intriguing prediction challenges, Defifa operates on a permissionless model, empowering players to become the ultimate arbiters of truth and immerse themselves in the arcade experience. Similar to an arcade, players insert tokens to participate in the games. In contrast to traditional arcades, Defifa welcomes anyone to create games that rallies around cultural moments while also offering money making opportunities.

## Built-on Juicebox

Defifa is built atop the Juicebox protocol. During the transaction where Ballkidz takes a fee from a game, both game creators and players are rewarded with $DEFIFA tokens, granting them power over the treasury's allocation and policies.. This treasury is used to catalyze player-led growth.

## Mission

Our mission is to cultivate an immersive, sustainable, and community-driven environment, evoking the vibrant atmosphere of a bustling arcade, where individuals are attracted to Defifa's innovative money games and enthusiastically contribute to its ongoing success.
