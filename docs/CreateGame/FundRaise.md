content about reserve rate and beneficiaries, different rates at each tier, can go to artist, charity, game owner etc

Default Beneficiary:
Defifa offers flexibility by allowing the default beneficiary to be set either for all NFT tiers or on a per-tier basis. At the contract level, an NFT tier can be thought of as a unique outcome within a game. For example, a tier could represent a Cubs win tomorrow or a Cubs loss. A beneficiary refers to an individual or entity that receives a certain percentage of mints as players mint each NFT tier. By designating a default beneficiary, game creators ensure a consistent allocation strategy for all tiers unless otherwise specified at the tier level.

Tier-Specific Beneficiaries:
In addition to the general allocation structure, Defifa provides the ability to define beneficiaries at the tier level. Each tier can have a distinct "reservedTokenBeneficiary" specified, indicating the address or entity entitled to a reserved portion of the mints. This allocation is referred to as the "reserveRate". For example, a reserve rate of "10" signifies that one out of every ten mints from that tier will be allocated to the specified beneficiary. This approach enables targeted distributions and encourages diverse participation within game creation. NFT artists, for instance, can be rewarded for their work by being a beneficiary of a specific tier.

By leveraging the flexibility and tier-specific beneficiary options in Defifa, creators can implement dynamic and rewarding allocation strategies. Whether it's ensuring consistent allocations through default beneficiaries or promoting targeted distributions with tier-specific beneficiaries, Defifa opens up new possibilities for fundraising and incentivizing creators within the realm of NFTs and gaming.
